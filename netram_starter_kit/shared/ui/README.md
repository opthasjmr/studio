# Vision Care Plus Shared UI Library

This directory is intended to host shared UI components that can be used across different frontend applications within the Vision Care Plus monorepo (e.g., `web-client`, `mobile-client` if it uses a compatible framework like React Native Web, or a potential Storybook setup).

## Purpose

-   **Consistency:** Ensure a consistent look and feel across all Vision Care Plus applications.
-   **Reusability:** Avoid code duplication by creating common UI elements once.
-   **Maintainability:** Centralize UI logic and styling for easier updates and bug fixes.

## Technology

-   Typically built with **React** and a styling solution like **Tailwind CSS**, **Styled Components**, or **CSS Modules**.
-   For this project, if `web-client` uses ShadCN UI, this shared library could either:
    1.  Re-export configured ShadCN components.
    2.  Contain custom components built using ShadCN primitives or other libraries.
    3.  Be a place for truly generic components not tied to ShadCN specifically, if needed by other apps like the mobile client.

## Structure (Example)

```
/shared/ui/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── Button/
│   │   │   ├── Button.tsx
│   │   │   └── Button.stories.tsx (if using Storybook)
│   │   ├── Card/
│   │   ├── Modal/
│   │   └── ... (other common components)
│   ├── themes/
│   │   └── visioncareplus-theme.ts (e.g., Tailwind config, Material UI theme overrides)
│   └── index.ts          # Exports all components
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
└── README.md
```

## Development

-   **Storybook:** Consider using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to develop and showcase UI components in isolation.
-   **Build Process:** Set up a build process (e.g., using Rollup, esbuild, or tsup) to compile the components into a distributable format if they are to be consumed as a separate package. If used directly within a monorepo (e.g., via TypeScript path aliases or Yarn/PNPM workspaces), a complex build step might not be necessary for local development.

## Usage

Applications within the monorepo can import components from this shared library:

```typescript
// Example in apps/web-client/src/app/some-page.tsx
import { Button, Card } from '@visioncareplus/ui'; // Assuming @visioncareplus is the scope for your monorepo packages

function SomePage() {
  return (
    <Card>
      <Button>Click Me</Button>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

This is a placeholder. The actual implementation will depend on the chosen monorepo tooling (Yarn Workspaces, PNPM Workspaces, Lerna, Nx, Turborepo) and the specific needs of the applications.
